# Chapter 7: Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Overview of Deep Reinforcement Learning
Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) integrates reinforcement learning (RL) principles with deep learning architectures to handle complex, high-dimensional environments. This synergy allows agents to learn optimal policies directly from raw sensory inputs, such as images or sounds, enabling applications in fields like robotics, game playing, and autonomous driving.

## Traditional Reinforcement Learning vs Deep Reinforcement Learning

Traditional Reinforcement Learning relies on manually crafted features and tabular representations to approximate value functions or policies. While effective in low-dimensional and discrete action spaces, traditional RL struggles with scalability and generalization in high-dimensional environments.

Deep Reinforcement Learning, on the other hand, leverages deep neural networks to automatically extract hierarchical feature representations from raw inputs. This capability enables agents to operate in environments with vast state and action spaces, providing a significant advantage in complex decision-making tasks.

## The key distinctions between **Traditional RL** and **Deep RL**:

| **Aspect**                | **Traditional RL**                                   | **Deep RL**                                             |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Function Approximation** | Linear or tabular methods                            | Deep Neural Networks                                    |
| **Feature Engineering**    | Manual feature design                               | Automatic feature extraction                            |
| **Scalability**            | Limited to low-dimensional spaces                    | Handles high-dimensional, continuous spaces             |
| **Sample Efficiency**      | Generally more sample-efficient                      | Often requires more interaction data                    |
| **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**  | -                                                    | Combines Q-Learning with deep neural networks, enabling agents to learn policies from high-dimensional sensory inputs |

## Q-Learning Recap
Q-Learning seeks to learn the optimal action-value function ( Q^(s, a) ), which predicts the expected cumulative reward of taking action ( a ) in state ( s ) and following the optimal policy thereafter. The Bellman equation defines ( Q^(s, a) ) as:


$$
Q^*(s, a) = \mathbb{E} \left[ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q^*(s', a') \mid s, a \right]
$$
Where:

- $ r $ is the immediate reward,
- $ \gamma $ is the discount factor,
- $ s' $ is the next state,
- $ a' $ is the next action.
- Deep Q-Network Architecture
In DQN, a deep neural network approximates the Q-function $ Q(s, a; \theta )$, where $ \theta $ represents the network parameters. The network outputs Q-values for all possible actions given an input state $ s $.

Training involves minimizing the loss between the predicted Q-values and target Q-values derived from the Bellman equation:


$$
L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{(s, a, r, s') \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \left( r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a'; \theta^-) - Q(s, a; \theta) \right)^2 \right]
$$
Where:

- $\mathcal{D} $ is the distribution of experiences,
- $ \theta^- $ are the parameters of the target network.
Experience Replay
Experience Replay addresses the correlation between sequential samples by storing experiences $ (s, a, r, s') $ in a replay buffer $ \mathcal{D} $. During training, mini-batches are uniformly sampled from $ \mathcal{D} $ to break the temporal correlations and stabilize learning.

## Target Networks
To mitigate the instability arising from simultaneously updating the Q-network, DQN employs a separate target network with parameters $ \theta^- $. These parameters are periodically synchronized with the primary network's parameters $ \theta $:


$$
\theta^- \leftarrow \theta
$$
Using a target network provides a more stable target for the Q-value updates, enhancing the convergence properties of the learning algorithm.

## Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) extends the deterministic policy gradient method to handle high-dimensional, continuous action spaces. It combines the advantages of DQN and policy gradient methods, enabling efficient learning in environments where actions are not discrete.

## Actor-Critic Framework
DDPG employs an actor-critic architecture:

Actor: Learns a deterministic policy $ \mu(s|\theta^\mu) $ that maps states to specific actions.
Critic: Estimates the Q-function $ Q(s, a|\theta^Q) $ using the actor's actions.
Algorithm Components
Policy Update: The actor's policy is updated via the deterministic policy gradient:

$$
    \nabla_{\theta^\mu} J \approx \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \nabla_a Q(s, a|\theta^Q) \big|_{a=\mu(s)} \nabla_{\theta^\mu} \mu(s|\theta^\mu) \right]
    $$
Critic Update: The critic minimizes the loss between predicted Q-values and target Q-values:

$$
    L(\theta^Q) = \mathbb{E}_{(s, a, r, s') \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \left( r + \gamma Q(s', \mu(s'|\theta^{\mu^-})|\theta^{Q^-}) - Q(s, a|\theta^Q) \right)^2 \right]
    $$
Target Networks: Similar to DQN, DDPG utilizes target networks for both actor and critic to stabilize updates.
Exploration Strategy: Since the policy is deterministic, exploration is introduced by adding noise to the actions, often using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.
DDPG effectively handles continuous action spaces by learning a deterministic policy, making it suitable for complex control tasks.

## Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a policy gradient method designed to improve training stability and efficiency. PPO addresses the limitations of earlier methods like TRPO by simplifying the optimization process while maintaining reliable performance.

Objective Function
PPO introduces a clipped surrogate objective to restrict policy updates within a trust region, preventing large, destabilizing parameter changes:


$$
L^{CLIP}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t \left[ \min \left( r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon) \hat{A}_t \right) \right]
$$
Where:

- $ r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_t|s_t)} $ is the probability ratio,
- $ \hat{A}_t $ is the estimated advantage at time $ t $,
- $ \epsilon $ is a hyperparameter dictating the clipping range.
Advantages of PPO
Simplicity: Easier to implement compared to TRPO, requiring fewer computational resources.
Performance: Demonstrates competitive performance across various benchmark tasks.
Stability: The clipping mechanism effectively prevents destructive policy updates, enhancing training stability.
## PPO Variants
- PPO-Penalty: Incorporates a penalty term based on the KL divergence between the new and old policies.
- PPO-Clip: Uses the clipped surrogate objective as described above, which is more commonly used due to its simplicity and effectiveness.
- PPO has become a popular choice in Deep RL due to its balance between performance and computational efficiency.

## Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) is a policy gradient method aimed at ensuring monotonic improvement in policy updates by constraining the step size in policy space.

Objective Function
TRPO maximizes the expected advantage while enforcing a trust region constraint on the KL divergence between the new and old policies:


$$
\max_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_t \left[ \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_t|s_t)} \hat{A}_t \right] \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \mathbb{E}_t \left[ \text{KL} \left( \pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(\cdot|s_t) \| \pi_\theta(\cdot|s_t) \right) \right] \leq \delta
$$
Where:

- $ \delta $ is a predefined threshold for the KL divergence.
Conjugate Gradient and Fisher Information Matrix
To solve the constrained optimization problem, TRPO employs the conjugate gradient method combined with the Fisher Information Matrix to compute a natural gradient direction that respects the trust region constraint.

Advantages and Limitations
Advantages:

### Monotonic Improvement: Guarantees that each policy update does not degrade performance.
Theoretical Foundations: Strong theoretical underpinnings ensuring convergence properties.
Limitations:

### Computational Complexity: Involves expensive second-order computations, making it less scalable.
Implementation Complexity: More intricate to implement compared to simpler policy gradient methods.
TRPO paved the way for more efficient policy optimization algorithms like PPO by highlighting the importance of constrained policy updates for stable learning.
